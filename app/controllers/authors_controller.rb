# Define the "invalid path" for the create and update controller actions.

# FORMS
# Create forms with form_tag for both models' new and edit actions.
# Prefill already-submitted forms with the invalid data when re-rendering.
# Display a list of errors at the top of forms when an invalid action is attempted. They should be contained in an element with id error_explanation, and each error should have its own <li>.
# Conditionally wrap each field in a .field_with_errors div if it has errors.
